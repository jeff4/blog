Today is my last day in Italy. :( I did the opposite of what I'd been doing the last week. Instead of spending five days in one museum, I visited 5 galleries and gardens all on Friday 10 April. First, I met a friend (from California who happened to be traveling in Italy this week) for coffee at the Uffizi, then had lunch with her and her friends, and then went through the Uffizi one last time, then went to the Galileo Museum, then went to Palazzi Pitti where I saw their Palatine Gallery, Modern Art Gallery, Costume Exhibit, and Boboli Gardens. Quite a whirlwind of a day!

For my final dinner, I had a wonderful home-cooked meal with my Airbnb family.  Now it's time to get on the plane for Dublin via Munich! Here are some photos in no particular order.
