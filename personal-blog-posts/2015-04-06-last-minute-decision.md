At 7 am today, I decided to take a day trip to [Siena](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena). My good friend Justin has raved about it saying that it has probably his favorite Duomo in Italy. So I checked the bus schedule, used [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) to quickly download a bunch of articles for offline reading, and ran to the central Florence bus station. Good thing too, b/c there was quite a line to buy tickets (and the bus company's website doesn't work too well plus it's only in Italian). Fingers crossed that this last minute adventure works out well!
