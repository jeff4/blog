Ah, the [power of Instagram](https://instagram.com/p/1XVWYKoyri/?taken-by=instajeff4)â€”the original photo did not look nearly as cool before some postproduction edits. I'm glad my edits to the photo really bring out the lime green of the airport worker and the more grassy green of the baggage cart. Very appropriate for the rainy [Emerald Isle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Isle). :) For my final dinner, I had a wonderful home-cooked meal with my Airbnb family.  Now it's time to get on the plane for Dublin via Munich! Here are some photos in no particular order.
