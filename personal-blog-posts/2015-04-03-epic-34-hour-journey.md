title: Epic 34-hour journey from Killarney to Florence
tags: florence misc

OK, it's taken me 34 hours to get from my [conference hotel](http://www.theeurope.com) in Ireland to my AirBnB in Florence. **tl;dr:** *it was a multi-step pain in the ass but I got to Italy eventually.*

My original plan after [Úll](http://2015.ull.ie) was to take the train from the conference in Killarney to Dublin, take a flight from Dublin to [Bologna, Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) (via a connecting flight in Frankfurt, Germany).  Here is what happened instead:

## The Killarney - Dublin train charges different prices based on how you buy the ticket
I left the [Europe hotel](http://www.theeurope.com) for the [Killarney train station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney_railway_station) at 9 am, Wed 1 April. Despite my earlier online research, it turns out that the 25 € train ticket between Killarney and Dublin cost 68 € at the vending machine in the [Killarney train station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killarney_railway_station)! While using up the precious remaining 150 MB of data on my SIM card, I tried to use the [Irish Rail's website](http://www.irishrail.ie) to purchase a ticket. Of course, online booking did not allow me to book the next train so i had to book one several hours later, for the price of 48 €. At the same time, this was a race against time because the mobile version of the Irish Rail website required 5 pages and dozens of fields. Partly this is my fault because I hadn't upgrated to a chip-and-pin credit card yet. But partly it was Irish Rail's fault because they were still in the process of implementing PayPal. After multiple attempts to purchase online (this means like 8 or 9 reloaded pages on my rapidly dwindling Vodaphone SIM card data plan), I was able to buy a ticket with a few minutes to spare before the train deparated Killarney.

## Search for a better SIM card
After talking to several conference attendees, I knew that I had gotten a rotten deal for my SIM card at the Dublin airport. Both [Vodaphone](http://www.vodafone.ie/sim-only-plans/) and [Meteor Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_(mobile_network)) offered 250 MB of data for 25 €. In contrast, my friends had gotten anywhere from 3 GB to *unlimited data* for a prepaid 30-day SIM for somewhere between 15 - 30 €. I resolved to get a better SIM card that would work in Italy—in Ireland if possible. This way, I could pre-empt the potential confusion of finding a good deal on the right SIM card in Italy (where English was probably less available than in Ireland).

I knew I had a few hours between the time my train arrived in Dublin and my flight to Germany departed. So before going to the airport, I ventured through Dublin looking for a store that sold SIM cards from [Three Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Ireland). I knew that these Three outlets were not available in the train station or at the airport. But I also knew from my new friends at Úll that Three offered a [special SIM for 20 €](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Phones/Feel_At_Home) that offered *unlimited data* and worked in Italy, Ireland, the US, and many countries besides. After walking about 1.5 miles through the rain, I found this [Three store](http://graftonstreet.ie/places/mobile-phones/3-store/) near [Grafton Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton_Street). I also realized where the [Cambridge bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/grafton-street-cambridge) got it's name. I'm so old I remember when Grafton Street was newly open and now it's almost 20 years old!

After buying my SIM card, I got a taxi to the airport.

## Delayed flight from Dublin to Frankfurt 

Because of rain and a mishap earlier that day at the Dublin airport, my flight from Dublin to Frankfurt was delayed. This missing my final Lufthansa connection from Frankfurt to Bologna and standing in line with hundreds of angry customers around midnight. Finally, the counter told everyone that they were sending everyone to hotels because there were going to be no more bookings for the night.

## Unexpected overnight stay in Frankfurt

I got to stay at a nice [Marriott in downtown Frankfurt](http://www.yelp.com/biz/frankfurt-marriott-hotel-frankfurt-am-main). See [this post](http://www.jeffhwang.me/blog/2015/04/01/photos-from-frankfurt-marriott) for views from my hotel.

## Gambling on a better flight to Florence instead of Bologna

I could have just gotten on the 8 am Bologna flight Lufthansa rebooked me on Thursday morning (April 2nd). But I decided to gamble to see if I could get onto a different flight directly to Florence, where my Airbnb was. This entailed being on the phone with Lufthansa for about 10 minutes and standing in various lines at the Frankfurt airport for about 2 hours. In the end, I had to take a Bologna flight. 

## Bus from Bologna airport to Florence

I had been hoping to save time, hassle, and money by going directly to Florence, my primary destination. It all worked out in the end though. Turns out there is [a direct bus from the Bologna airport to Florence](http://www.appenninoshuttle.it) for only 20 €. So after a long journey, I finally got to my Airbnb at 7 pm the evening of Thursday 2 April.
