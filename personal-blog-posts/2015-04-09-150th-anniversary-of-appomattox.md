150 years ago today, the American Civil War essentially ended when [Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House). I'm returning home to America soon and today seems like a fitting day to reflect on my country and it's complicated history.

I've long been a fan of [Ta-Nehisi Coates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta-Nehisi_Coates) since sometime in 2007-2008 when he guest-blogged for [Matt Yglesias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Yglesias). I read many of TNC's posts on the Civil war in the 2009 - 2012 period but did not dig into the other material he recommended. For some reason, a few months ago, I followed the advice that fellow TNC fan [Kimberlit8 skillfully summarizes here](http://kimberlite8.livejournal.com/14459.html):

1. Read *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson
1. Listen to David Blight's free audio lectures version of his intro to Civil War history class at Yale. This set of lectures were recorded in the spring of 2008 during the Obama - Clinton primary campaign, before we knew we would have our first African-American president.
1. Watch the famous Ken Burns PBS documentary *The Civil War*.

I've only skimmed about 250 of the 900 pages of the McPherson book and it lives up to it's reputation as the best single volume on the Civil War published in the last 25 years. I've listened to about 22 hours of the 29 hours of the Blight lectures which are similarly eye-opening. Finally, I've finished 8 of the 9 hours of the Ken Burns documentary.

There is so much to say about the American Civil War and it's legacy. About how the ACW is the only major war that I know of where the losers actually got to dominate the narrative—hence the continuing consequence of Lost Cause mythology through the South in particular and American political culture in general.

I suppose I will let David Blight have the last word as he is such an excellent scholar and teacher on the topic. He [published this yesterday in the Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-civil-war-isnt-over/389847/):

>On this 150th anniversary of the surrender at Appomattox, Americans mark the end of the Civil War. The questions at the heart of the war, though, still occupy the nation, which has never truly gotten over that conflict. The great issues of the war were not resolved on that April morning at Appomattox. In this sense, not only is the Civil War not over; it can still be lost....

> [The Second American Revolution]—the Civil War—was so bloody, so devastating, a “result so fundamental and astounding,” as Lincoln put it, that ever since, Americans of all backgrounds have yearned to declare, or at least feel, its deepest issues over and resolved. Americans may love the epic story of their Civil War, but would, by and large, prefer its nightmarish causes and consequences to fall quiet, to rest in peace...

> In the wake of this war, Americans faced a profound and all but impossible challenge of achieving two deeply contradictory goals—healing and justice. Healing took generations in many families, if it ever came at all. Justice was fiercely contested. It was not the same proposition for the freedmen and their children as it was for white Southerners, in the wake of their military, economic and psychological defeat. And in America, as much as it sometimes astonishes foreigners, the defeated in this civil war eventually came to control large elements of the event’s meaning, legacies, and policy implications, a reality wracked with irony and driven by the nation’s persistence racism...

>A shooting war between huge formal armies did indeed end in the spring of 1865 after four years of physical, environmental, social, and human devastation. Militarily, the United States was the clear victor; the war ended in four formal surrenders of Confederate armies to Union commanders. The first and most famous was at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 12, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered 21,000 starving troops to General Ulysses S. Grant, in a scene immortalized in American memory... 

>The very word “Appomattox” would settle into American memory and parlance as a prime marker of historical time...as a divider between a world before and a world after “the war.”...Yet Appomattox was not the end of the war. Three more military surrenders occurred over the next month and a half...

>[But more to the point,] these apparently conclusive and clean surrenders masked the difficult and conflicted post-war era that would follow. The war ended with revolutionary and lasting results that echo down to the present day—especially in the two broad questions of racial equality and federalism. A great deal of American political, constitutional, and social history can be read through these two broad, likely eternal challenges...

> The Reconstruction era, stretching from 1865 to 1877, was one long referendum on the meaning and memory of the verdicts reached at Appomattox...The litany of horror and blood [from Recronstruction] can become almost endless, and it represents the one time in American history when sustained uses of terror successfully worked to transform political regimes...

>Much has changed in the fifty years since the crises of 1963—in law, in schooling, in scholarship, in race relations. But whatever the engines of history actually are, what seems apparent is that the legacies of the American Civil War have tended to subside and reemerge in a never-ending succession of revolutions and counter-revolutions. Indeed, the presidency of Barack Obama might be seen as a robust new chapter in this story. A significant segment of American society hates the President and cannot seem to abide a black family living in the White House.

>American society seems to surge forward one moment, and then in the next sink back into polarization over race and ethnicity, over the advent of the nation’s first black president, over the rights of immigrants, over religious tolerance and birthright citizenship, over reproductive freedom, over the use of basic science to understand climate change, over the extent and protection of voting rights, over civil rights based on sexual preference, and over endless and incompatible claims of “liberty” about the possession and use of firearms, taxation, environmental protection, or the right to health insurance. Perhaps above all, America is a society riven by conflict over federalism, the never-ending debate over the proper relation of federal to state power, perhaps the most lasting a legacy of what many nineteenth century Americans called the “secession war” or simply “the rebellion.” In short, despite enormous changes of heart, head and law, Americans still struggle every day to discern and enact that society of equality that the Civil War at least made imaginable...

>The radical wing of the conservative movement in America, still ascendant in Congress and dominant in most of the South, seems determined to repeal much of the twentieth-century social legislation, and even tear up its constitutional and social roots in the transformations of the 1860s. As Americans disturbingly learn, generation after generation, many have never fully accepted the verdicts of Appomattox....

>Wars end loudly and in ruins, and sometimes on silent, beautiful spring landscapes such as the surrender field at Appomattox; but history keeps happening.
