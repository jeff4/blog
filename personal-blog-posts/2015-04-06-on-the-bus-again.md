Well, that was a quick trip to Siena! Had a short but intense visit.  I will have a lot to say about it when I'm in front of my laptop again. I'm already on the bus that will return me to Florence. Here's a teaser: hunger and VR will play a role in my next post. And no, I'm not running back to play a [zombie game with the Oculus Rift](http://www.themarysue.com/dying-light-oculus-rift-demo/)!
