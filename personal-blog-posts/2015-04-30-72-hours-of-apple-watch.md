I've spent about 72 hours with the Apple Watch now. As I mentioned previously, I've been very casual in my usage. I'm try to use it very lightly rather than digging deep into all the functionality the way a professional reviewer might be required to.

I've done a few simple things to improve my enjoyment. I didn't realize I could even do this until day 2 or day 3.

* **Turn off the Stand-Up notification**— This is tapping my wrist too frequently and the detection/calculation system is still too dumb. 
* **Curate the App Menu**— I found the default menu to be too overloaded with default apps. So I removed pretty much all 3rd party apps and rearranged things such that my most commonly used apps are at the top of a pyramid
* **Curate the Glances available**—I didn't realize until Day 3 that you can configure the order of the Glances and even decide which are not shown at all. I now love the Glances interaction much more. My top 4 glances: (1) the audio menu to control podcasts including play/pause/ff/rewind, (2) the stocks glance, (3) the battery power glance, and (4) the general settings glance.

With just the 3 adjustments above, my Watch feels significantly more personable, functional, and delightful. I'm hoping and assuming that future versions of the Activity Monitor become smarter.
