I first visited the Met about 20 years ago and I returned today for the first time since last summer. The Met is still my favorite single art museum in the US. It was great reacquainting myself with works by [Vermeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer), [Rubens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens), [Ingres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres), [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David), [Courbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Courbet), [Manet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Édouard_Manet), and [Rothko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko). 

There were two works that struck me, independent of all the famous art I had previously learned about in art history class or through general cultural osmosis. The first is [Joan of Arc](http://metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/89.21.1) (1879) by Jules Bastien-LePage.

The second is a set of chromaprints from the current exhibit ["Fatal Attraction: Piotr Uklański Photographs"](http://metmuseum.org/exhibitions/objects?exhibitionId={FEC4D35C-3D1C-4C17-A03F-2AB1FB4C1F47}) In particular, I am drawn to one large sky-blue piece (2001) which is right next to a mirrored orange and purple piece (2005). They look like updated versions of Rothko's color field paintings from mid-century.
