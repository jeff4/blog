[Caravaggio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio) (1571-1610) was only 39 when he died. Since much of [the Gherardo delle Notti exhibit](/blog/2015/04/04/uffizi-day-2-gherardo-delle-notti) describes the lessons Honthorst learned from Caravaggio, I was surprised to learn that Honthorst was only 20 years younger. But then I remembered a 21-year-old I met recently was truly so much younger than me. It's easy to forget when looking across centuries that someone born in 1571 is actually much more experienced than someone born in 1592. 

The only Caravaggio I've seen today is [his "Tooth Puller"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_attributed_to_Caravaggio#The_Tooth_Puller) from 1609, usually located in the Palazzo Pitti here in Florence. Things that struck me:

* Caravaggio's characteristic realism that focuses on naturalistic poses.

* Caravaggio's special talent in making skin and flesh feel tangible, human, almost touchable. Look at the man in the right foreground. As he leans his face on his left arm, his fist pushes his cheek into sharp horizontal folds. His skin makes more of an impact when seeing the painting in person; the photo here really doesn't do it justice! Another reason we still go to museums in person. :)

* The poor patient is in obvious pain. His left hand is outstretched in agony, fingers spread wide. His right hand tightly grips the arm of his chair. There is terrible agony that far outstrips the small amount of blood coming out of his mouth.

* The dentist's face is near the top of the painting and almost exactly centered. He has a strangely lecherous look; he gazes straight out of the picture plane, directly at the viewer.
