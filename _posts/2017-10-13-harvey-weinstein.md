A little more than a week ago, the New York Times published a carefully researched [article about Harvey Weinstein's decades-long record of sexual harassment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html). Ronan Farrow then published the results of his 10-month investigation, [originally planned for NBC](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nbc-harvey-weinstein_us_59de5688e4b0eb18af059685), in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories). 

A cascade of people have now come forward with their own stories. Weinstein's behavior is reprehensible but is not unique to  Hollywood. I keep coming back to two pieces written this week. Liz Meriwether is a brilliant comedic writer but there is nothing funny about [her story in New York magazine](https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/im-a-coward.html). And [Jia Tolentino](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/how-men-like-harvey-weinstein-implicate-their-victims-in-their-acts) is terrible and precise in The New Yorker. 

Our society has to do better.
