As a difficult year draws to a close, I'd like to end 2016 on a hopeful note. **Machine learning has broken through to the mainstream.** In a real sense, artificial intelligence is here to stay. This is a bit surprising because AI has seen half a dozen booms and busts since the 1950's.  The cycle is so frequent that the term [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) was coined many years before [Jackie Fenn](http://www.gartner.com/books/hype-cycle/theauthors.jsp) introduced the [Gartner hype cycle](http://foresightinvestor.com/articles/109289-gartner-s-hype-cycle) in 1995.

Here are some favorite pieces from the past year:

* Over the summer, Steven Levy at Backchannel detailed how [Google is retraining its engineers](https://backchannel.com/how-google-is-remaking-itself-as-a-machine-learning-first-company-ada63defcb70#.sulu98o1z) in a bid to move Alphabet from being a search company to a mobile company to an AI-first company.

* In March, Jeff Atwood published a great blog post about [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)  and how [the last decade of GPU advancements](https://blog.codinghorror.com/thanks-for-ruining-another-game-forever-computers/) has been critical to the rise of practical machine learning / deep learning. 

* Daniel Terdiman wrote an in-depth Fast Company article about how [Yann LeCun is building the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) program](https://www.fastcompany.com/3060570/facebooks-formula-for-winning-at-ai) in collaboration with the engineering-oriented Facebook Applied Machine Learning (AML) team led by Joaquin Candela. 

* In September, [Microsoft announced a major reorganization](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/microsoft-forms-new-ai-research-group-led-by-harry-shum/) where Microsoft Research (founded 25 years ago) combined with AI staff previously distributed throughout the company to form [the Microsoft AI and Research Group](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-expands-artificial-intelligence-ai-efforts-with-creation-of-new-microsoft-ai-and-research-group-300336485.html) with 5,000 computer scientists and engineers. 

* Just last week, the New York Times published a long but very worthwhile Sunday Magazine article by Gideon Lewis-Kraus about how [Google has moved AI/ML out of the lab and into the hands of half a billion users per month](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html). The article starts with multilingual translation but goes on to talk about image recognition, artificial vision, and many other things. 

* Finally, I encourage everyone to watch this [excellent slideshow](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/) by Frank Chen at Andreessen Horowitz. It provides a nice history of AI and excellent overview of machine learning and deep learning.
