I've been listening to [this excellent series of lectures on the Civil War](http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-119) given by David Blight at Yale in 2008. In [Lecture 24](http://oyc.yale.edu/transcript/565/hist-119) - *Retreat from Reconstruction: The Grant Era and Paths to 'Southern Redemption'*, Prof. Blight starts by saying:

> Frederick Douglass gave a speech in 1875 that gives us a question that we might keep in mind right through the end of the course. Let's call this "Douglass's question." It's a speech he gives in 1875 in Washington, D.C. Douglass is anticipating the coming year of the U.S. centennial of independence, and he knows it's going to be a big national celebration in 1876.

>But Douglass is anticipating this national centennial, ten years after the Civil War, and he's worried. He said, "The nation would lift to the sky its million voices in one grand centennial hosanna of peace and goodwill to all the white race, from gulf to lakes, and from sea to sea." And as a black citizen, he dreaded the day, he said — listen to his words, it's one of the most racialized speeches Douglass ever gave. He said he dreaded the day when, his words, "this great white race has renewed its vows of patriotism and flowed back into its accustomed channels." He was proud, he said, to be an American, but he was worried. And then he ended with this question. **"If war among the whites brought peace and liberty to blacks, what will peace among the whites bring?"**

> What would peace among the whites bring? It's a way of shaping an overall question, and Douglass did it for us, as to how and why Reconstruction ended up eroding, collapsing if you want, failing as some say — ending.

A powerful question indeed. Douglass is quickly becoming my favorite orator of the 19th century, a time of many great American speakers and writers.

A [quick Google search](https://www.google.com/#q=douglass+one+grand+centennial+hosanna+of+peace+and+goodwill+to+all+the+white+race%2C+from+gulf+to+lakes%2C+and+from+sea+to+sea) only brings up secondary references to this 1875 speech in DC, such as on page 453 of a [history textbook](http://www.amazon.com/People-Nation-History-United-States-ebook/dp/B00B7JK1NE) that Blight co-authored. When I have time, I'll update this post with the complete text of the Douglass' speech.
