I think it's worthwhile to interrogate what ingredients went into Apple having such a powerful developer ecosystem.

Sinofsky and Vic Gundotra have both competed and succeeded against Apple at Microsoft historically. What is different now? Now that neither of them must advocate against Apple's approach (the way they did when they were based in Redmond, or in Gundotra's case, in Mountain View), they can more objectively describe Apple's advantage?
