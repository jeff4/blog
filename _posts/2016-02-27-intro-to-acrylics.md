I just finished my first acrylic painting class.  It's an intro course and the teacher let me move from the still life studies to try my hand at making abstract color field pieces inspired by Rothko.

I've learned a little about color theory, paint mixing, using medium as a transparent layer, and a tiny amount of managing and stretching canvases. I'm proud to say that I've learned a little about how to manage delicate transitions like this photo of a lighter yellow field against a more saturated yellow background.
