This sentence has never before been written: **Apple Maps is now superior to Google Maps.** And it's all because of Apple Watch.

Before [getting the Watch last week](http://www.jeffhwang.me/blog/2015/04/27/early-apple-watch), I [used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps) a [range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps) of [GPS apps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waze) on my iPhone. It's inarguable that [Apple Maps sucked](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/apple-map-fails-ios-6-maps_n_1901599.html) during and after its 2012 launch. Apple's data quality was so bad that the company [issued a rare apology](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-maps/) and [recommended competing alternatives](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-apologizes-for-apple-maps-points-to-competitive-alternatives/).

Over time, Apple has made [nice strides on data accuracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/28nkez/apple_maps_is_finally_improving_poi_data_and/). By early 2015, my own usage had settled into this pattern: roughly 50% Google Maps, 35% Apple Maps, 15% Waze.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> If I could change the default mapping app on iOS, I would have used Apple Maps even less.

Most observers believed that Apple would never catch up to Google, much less outpace them. In addition their formidable headstart, Google seemed to be accelerating the power of its combined machine and human mapping effort. As John Siracusa [observed](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/87) on [Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/88), Apple has generally not been good at this type of project. In the long term, it looked like Apple would always be left behind.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

During the last week, I've been using **Apple Maps 80% of the time**. The reason? The Watch dramatically improves my experience across these dimensions:

1. **Focus**— By *only* showing the next upcoming GPS direction, the visual cues from Maps on the Watch is much more relevant, useful, and clear than those from the iPhone. This is true even though my phone is hands-free, mounted on my car dashboard, and has a large, well-lit screen. 
2. **Haptic reinforcement**—[The series of twelve taps for a right turn and trio of two taps for left turn really help](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/23/apple-watch-user-guide)! This sound trivial. (e.g. "Why do you need the touch reinforcement on your wrist when you already have the visual signal from your dash-mounted iPhone and 2nd visual signal from your Watch face??") But once you experience the tapping, you don't really want to go back.
3. **Directions while the iPhone screen is turned to another app or even turned off**—I can keep my iPhone on my favorite podcast app or just even have the screen off. This is nice during night driving because I like having a dark cabin and the brightness of the iPhone screen can be distracting at night.

When it comes to Maps, the Watch has delivered for both the consumer and Apple. The consumer has a better experience. The company now has a better overall Maps experience than Google, Waze, or anyone else. 

The mutual support Apple Watch and Maps give to each other present a small but striking example of corporate synergy (sorry for the buzzword!). I was one of many skeptics of [the "halo effect" in the early 2000's](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/Analysts_Agree_Apples_Halo_Effect_Might_Be_the_Real_Deal). Even during the heyday of the iPod, Mac sales growth was excellent but not earth-shattering. That changed with the iPhone, the iPad, and now the Watch. The halo looks bright.

<sup id="fn1">1. I generally only use Waze when I'm driving through rush-hour where alternate traffic routes are really helpful.<a href="#ref1" title="Return to text.">↩</a></sup>

<sup id="fn2">2. Apple should have seriously outbid Google when it came to [the Waze acquisition](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/11/its-official-google-buys-waze-giving-a-social-data-boost-to-its-location-and-mapping-business/). I don't like the visual and UX design of Waze, but the quality of its data is excellent. Waze being incorporated into Apple Maps would have been a powerful combination. This was definitely a miss on Apple's part.<a href="#ref2" title="Return to text.">↩</a></sup>
