I decided to spend the Memorial Day weekend visiting museums in DC again. I spent a few hours each at [the National Gallery of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art) and [the National Air and Space Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Air_and_Space_Museum). My favorite visit today was at the [Hirshhorn Museum](http://hirshhorn.si.edu). It has a small exhibition space but I enjoyed the work by [Barbara Kruger](http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/barbara-kruger/), [Robert Irwin](http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/robert-irwin/), and [Linn Meyers](http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/home/#collection=linn-meyers).
