Today, I crossed the street from my Airbnb on Via Ricasoli to the [Accademia Gallery or Galleria dell'Accademia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_dell'Accademia). The Accademia is most famous as the home of [Michaelangelo's *David*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)). I'll have a post up with my observations on *David* in the next few days. 

For now, I wanted to share some other photos I took today. It turns out that the Accademia houses [an impressive collection of musical instruments](http://www.accademia.org/explore-museum/halls/museum-musical-instruments/), including a violin, a viola, and a cello made by [Antonio Stradivari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari).  These are some of the most precious stringed instruments in existence. On the open market, the pieces in these photos are collectively worth [somewhere in the neighborhood](http://www.cmuse.org/12-most-expensive-violins/) of [$10 - $40 million](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/worlds-most-expensive-instrument-stradivarius-viola-fails-to-sell)! Another thing I didn't realize is that Stradivari had a wonderfully long and productive life. He was **93 (maybe 94) years old** when he [died in 1737](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Stradivari#.22Golden.22_period_and_later_years)!
