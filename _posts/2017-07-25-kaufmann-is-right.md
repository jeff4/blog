There's been a bit of kerfluffle the last few days between "AI optimists" like Mark Zuckerberg and "pessimists" like Elon Musk. As a side-note, I think pessimism is better defined as "thinking AI is overhyped" versus "Skynet is going to enslave/exterminate mankind". Maybe AI doomsaying or apocalypticism.

I'd call myself a pessimist because despite the amazing research advances of the last few years (especially related to deep learning), I think that many people underestimate how much work is still needed to make AI systems useful or accessible in the wider world. Over the next decade and half-century after that,  AI will prove that it is a foundational technology  but before then, many AI systems will be very limited at best. At some point, I need to write an article about narrow AI versus Artificial General Intelligence.

This mini-debate between Musk and Zuckerberg did inspire a thoughtful [Techcrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/artificial-intelligence-is-not-as-smart-as-you-or-elon-musk-think/) by Ron Miller. The most interesting aspect is this quote:

>Pascal Kaufmann, founder at Starmind, a startup that wants to help companies use collective human intelligence to find solutions to business problems, has been studying neuroscience for the past 15 years. He says the human brain and the computer operate differently and it’s a mistake to compare the two. **“The analogy that the brain is like a computer is a dangerous one, and blocks the progress of AI,”** he says.
>
>Further, Kaufmann believes we won’t advance our understanding of human intelligence if we think of it in technological terms. **“It is a misconception that [algorithms] works like a human brain. People fall in love with algorithms and think that you can describe the brain with algorithms and I think that’s wrong,”** he said.

One of the first things that really struck me when I started machine learning more seriously in the last year was how fundamentally different computer and biological systems are. While neurobiology was an *inspiration* for the first perceptrons and neural networks decades ago, modern neural networks are extremely different from actual neuron systems in animals. There may be interesting cross-pollination in terms of learning and thinking. But ultimately, computer systems are best understood by building them as systems in and of themselves. And biologists do their best work studying the model animals in question; not by overapplying learnings from neural networks to organisms.
