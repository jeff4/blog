One of my favorite writers/analysts Benedict Evans [presented this](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/28/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world) last week, extending his boss Marc Andreessen's Software is Eating the World thesis. It's worth both viewing [the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/a16z/mobile-is-eating-the-world-40841467?ref=http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/10/28/presentation-mobile-is-eating-the-world) and watching the [video presentation](http://vimeo.com/110428014); Evans recapitulates many of the great points he's been making past 6 months.  It's an excellent summary all in one place.
