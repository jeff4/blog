I've worked on and off as a product manager at small software startups and large tech companies going back to the 90's dotcom bubble. More importantly, I've carefully observed and collaborated with a wide range of PMsâ€“many personalities, industries, and customer segments. 

The product function has evolved a ton as technology, tools, processes, and philosophies have all shifted in the last two decades. That said, my personal philosophy of product can be distilled into three critical areas.  

A great product manager needs to deliver:

1. **A clear view** of what the product is and *what it is not*. Who are its primary customers today and tomorrow? What is the product essence today and what should it evolve to be in the future? Depending on market and company, the overarching product thesis may be more consultative (i.e. driven by external customer demand, e.g. a lot of B2Bsoftware) or more internally-led (e.g., most Apple products). There are great PMs in both the consultative and vision-led camps. Incidentally, products driven by internal vision don't change their essence very much. The product essence of the iPhone now is amazingly close to what it was 10 years ago.
2. A **prioritized roadmap** that strikes the right balance between *stability* (to minimize churn for the design/dev teams) and *flexibility* (given the fast-changing nature of external/internal demands). A good roadmap is a living and breathing document that evolves at the appropriate pace.
3. **Relentless execution** to deliver against the roadmap. Shit always happens but like the Terminator, a good PM keeps soldiering on. :)

In addition to the critical jobs above, most product managers need to juggle a laundry list of other responsibilities. From what I've seen, these include communication, coordination, business model analysis, sales support, customer support, marketing support, competitive analysis, influencing other departments/execs/partners, and more besides.
