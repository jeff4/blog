Last summer,  [Frank Chen](https://a16z.com/author/frank-chen/) at [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) delivered an excellent introduction and [history of AI](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/).

He has followed up with another excellent [AI presentation](https://vimeo.com/215926017) with a comparison between AI and the history of relational databases. (I prefer the more accurate term [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)â€”relational database management systems.) :

>...[E.F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd) invented the term relational database working at IBM Research in 1970 and then Oracle implemented relational database in the late 70's and early 80's and basically since that time, we've watched the relational database get into every important piece of software that you write....[The RDBMS] was one these fundamental pieces of computer science that had such broad applicability it just got into every important piece of software. I think AI is going to be like that as well, which is, [AI] is going to get into every important piece of software.

Just as [I pondered the historical analogy](/blog/2014/what-time-is-it-in-the-mobile-revolution/) between the smartphone era and the web (or web search), I think about how the history of RDBMS suggests the path of AI going forward.

Even though Codd published the first papers on the relational model at IBM, his company did not build a strong RDBMS competitor to Oracle until more than 15 years later in the mid- to late-80s.
