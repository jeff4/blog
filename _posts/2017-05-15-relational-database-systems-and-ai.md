About a year ago, [Frank Chen](https://a16z.com/author/frank-chen/) at [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) delivered an excellent introduction and [history of AI](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/).

He has followed up with another excellent [AI presentation] with a comparison between AI and the history of relational databases. (I prefer the more accurate term RDBMSâ€”relational database management systems.) :

> So, E.F. Codd invented the term relational database working at IBM Research in 1970 and then Oracle implemented relational database in the late 70's and early 80's and basically since that time, we've watched the relational database get into every important piece of software that you write....[The RDBMS] was one these fundamental pieces of computer science that had such broad applicability it just got into every important piece of software. I think AI is going to be like that as well, which is, [AI] is going to get into every important piece of software.



> One way to think about relational databases is they made it very cheap to store and sort and count information. AI will do the same thing; it will make a class of things cheap. But what AI makes cheap is very different...
