My Apple Watch arrived today! A few quick notes:

* I'm glad I only skimmed the reviews by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/the_apple_watch), [Joanna Stern](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-review-what-the-apple-watch-does-bestmake-you-look-good-1428494694), [Farhad Manjoo](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html), [Nilay Pitel](http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review), et al. The gist I've heard from them on various podcasts like [the Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2015/04/15/ep-116), [iMore](http://www.imore.com/imore-show-452-apple-watch-price-right), and [Rocket](http://www.relay.fm/rocket/13) is that it's a surprisingly deep product for an Apple 1.0. Usually, Apple tries to do a few things—even just *one* thing—well. Instead, there is a lot to discover under the hood.

* My goal is to naturally uncover functionality as I need it, rather than doing a deep dive the way [John Siracusa did with each of his OS X reviews over the years](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/04/16/after-fifteen-years-ars-says-goodbye-to-john-siracusas-os-x-reviews/).

* At this point, my favorite Watch feature is using Apple Pay. It was surprisingly more convenient than using Apple Pay on the phone or any traditional methods of payment. I bought something at Walgreen's and had such a nice experience that I want every retailer and merchant to support Apple Pay.

* I also enjoyed using the Watch to play, pause, and fast-forward podcasts using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) in my car.

* This may just be my perception, but it *seems* like Siri is far more accurate on the Watch than on my iPhone 6. I'll observe this over time to see if this bears out.

Finally, the constraint of having a small screen has really encouraged focus. Focus on which options to allow, which notifications to surface. I think this aspect is going to be more powerful than people realize. Just as the smartphone app allowed a task-based focus that was hard in the context of desktop web apps, I think we will see a similar evolution where *specific* types of Watch interactions will be vastly superior to their functional equivalents on smartphones, tablets, or PC's.
