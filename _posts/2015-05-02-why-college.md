What is college good for? 

Some believe college is most important as a ladder for upward mobility and amelioration of economic inequality. This is the impetus behind [Obama's proposal](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-dash/a-guide-to-obamas-free-co_b_6801726.html) for [making](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/the-genius-of-obamas-two-year-college-proposal/384429/) community college [universally affordable](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/10/upshot/obamas-community-college-plan-a-reading-list.html). Others value college as the final training ground for nurturing liberal democracy, continuing Western civilization, or perpetuating the parent society's way of life. (I'm writing this post with a US-centric view because that is the system with which I am most familiar. However, the cultural/political argument for college as transmitting way of life could apply to other Western democracies like England and France or to quite different societies like China.)

Finally, there are those—[like Stanley Fish](http://www.worldcat.org/title/save-the-world-on-your-own-time/oclc/179802890)—who believe the best version of college focuses on the [pure academic mission](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/07/01/fish) without regard to economic or political ends.

There is a bit of overlap between these goals. For example, a capitalist society and liberal democracy can both benefit from a system that provides opportunity to poorer residents while also inculcating the values necessary to keep the system running.

But overall, the reason we have such contentious debates about college is that people disagree about the fundamental aims of college. Off the top of my head, I can list controversies around [for-profit universities](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-10-25/the-long-and-controversial-history-of-for-profit-colleges), whether MBA programs—even [Harvard Business School](http://poetsandquants.com/2014/03/21/hbs-bold-entry-into-the-digital-market/)—will be [disrupted by some version of online education](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/business-school-disrupted.html), and the [Thiel Fellows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship) who are encouraged to drop out of school. These debates are especially fierce as tuition and student loans have soared faster than core inflation over the last several decades.

Four years ago, [Louis Menand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Menand) wrote [an excellent article in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/live-and-learn-louis-menand) that helped tease out three different theories of college education. I would carve up these types of theories differently, but I'll save that for a future post. For now, let me quote and summarize his taxonomy

## Theory 1: Meritocracy and Hogwarts sorting hat

College is just a four-year long version of the [SAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT), the intellectual equivalent of the [NFL scouting combine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_scouting_combine). As Menand [writes](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/live-and-learn-louis-menand):

>In any group of people, it’s easy to determine who is the fastest or the strongest or even the best-looking. But picking out the most intelligent person is difficult, because intelligence involves many attributes that can’t be captured in a one-time assessment, like an I.Q. test. There is no intellectual equivalent of the hundred-yard dash. An intelligent person is open-minded, an outside-the-box thinker, an effective communicator, is prudent, self-critical, consistent, and so on. These are not qualities readily subject to measurement.

>Society needs a mechanism for sorting out its more intelligent members from its less intelligent ones, just as a track team needs a mechanism (such as a stopwatch) for sorting out the faster athletes from the slower ones. Society wants to identify intelligent people early on so that it can funnel them into careers that maximize their talents. It wants to get the most out of its human resources. College is a process that is sufficiently multifaceted and fine-grained to do this.

>College is, essentially, a four-year intelligence test. Students have to demonstrate intellectual ability over time and across a range of subjects. If they’re sloppy or inflexible or obnoxious—no matter how smart they might be in the I.Q. sense—those negatives will get picked up in their grades. As an added service, college also sorts people according to aptitude. It separates the math types from the poetry types. At the end of the process, graduates get a score, the G.P.A., that professional schools and employers can trust as a measure of intellectual capacity and productive potential. It’s important, therefore, that everyone is taking more or less the same test.

## Theory 2: Building a democratic society

Alternately, we want to make sure that the values, social norms, cultural practices, and method of government is passed from one generation to the next. Depending on the society, this may or may not include grounding in specific arts, literature, and the humanities. In [Menand's words](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/live-and-learn-louis-menand):

>In a society that encourages its members to pursue the career paths that promise the greatest personal or financial rewards, people will, given a choice, learn only what they need to know for success. They will have no incentive to acquire the knowledge and skills important for life as an informed citizen, or as a reflective and culturally literate human being. College exposes future citizens to material that enlightens and empowers them, whatever careers they end up choosing.

>In performing this function, college also socializes. It takes people with disparate backgrounds and beliefs and brings them into line with mainstream norms of reason and taste. Independence of mind is tolerated in college, and even honored, but students have to master the accepted ways of doing things before they are permitted to deviate. Ideally, we want everyone to go to college, because college gets everyone on the same page. It’s a way of producing a society of like-minded grownups.

>There is stuff that every adult ought to know, and college is the best delivery system for getting that stuff into people’s heads.

>A lot of confusion is caused by the fact that since 1945 American higher education has been committed to both theories. The system is designed to be both **meritocratic (Theory 1)** and **democratic (Theory 2)**. Professional schools and employers depend on colleges to sort out each cohort as it passes into the workforce, and elected officials talk about the importance of college for everyone. We want higher education to be available to all Americans, but we also want people to deserve the grades they receive.

## Theory 3: Economic skills building; no time wasted on liberal arts

To add to the aforementioned post-war confusion, Menand offers a third theory of university education. This theory is more purely focused on the skills needed to get a job and build a career. The first two theories emphasize how society benefits from college—in an economic sense (Theory 1) or in a democratic/social sense (Theory 2). Theory 3 is more narrowly focused on what does college do for an individual economic betterment? [Menad again](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/live-and-learn-louis-menand):

>Neither Theory 1 nor Theory 2 really explains how the educational system works for [60% of US college students]. **For them, college is basically a supplier of vocational preparation and a credentialling service. The theory that fits their situation—Theory 3—is that advanced economies demand specialized knowledge and skills**, and, since high school is aimed at the general learner, college is where people can be taught what they need in order to enter a vocation. A college degree in a non-liberal field signifies competence in a specific line of work.

>Theory 3 explains the growth of the non-liberal education sector. As work becomes more high-tech, employers demand more people with specialized training. It also explains the explosion in professional master’s programs. There are now well over a hundred master’s degrees available, in fields from Avian Medicine to Web Design and Homeland Security...When Barack Obama and Arne Duncan talk about how higher education is the key to the future of the American economy, this is the sector they have in mind. They are not talking about the liberal arts.

I encourage you to go read [the entire piece by Menand](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/06/06/live-and-learn-louis-menand) because it is rich, detailed, and thoughtful. It certainly stimulated my own thinking. I have a lot more to say and hope to return to this topic in another post soon.
