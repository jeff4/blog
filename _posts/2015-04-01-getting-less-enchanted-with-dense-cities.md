title: Getting less enchanted with dense cities

I first visited Paris when I was 20 and London when I was 31. I loved those first visits. Although I still enjoyed these cities on subsequent visits, I found myself lingering more on the greyness, the confusing streets, the bustle and crowding, the pollution. Honestly, that was my feeling walking through a light drizzle in Dublin today. More likely as I get older, I have less patience for rainy weather and dense urban environments. Hopefully I will feel differently about Florence tomorrow. This also makes me feel good about minimizing my time in Rome.
