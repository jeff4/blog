This is a photo of the [Medici Chapel](http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/Medici_chapels.html) which is part of the very large [Basilica di San Lorenzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_San_Lorenzo,_Florence). This is the site of one of the oldest churches in Europeâ€”originally consecrated in [393 A.D. by St. Ambrose of Milan](http://www.florenceholidays.com/florence-vacation-churches-basilica_of_san_lorenzo.html)! The Basilica of San Lorenzo is famous for many things such as being the family burial place of the Medici dynasty that was so influential in Florence and Italy for centuries. Well-worth a daytime visit somtime. The amazing thing was that I wasn't even looking for the Basilica and it's so large it's hard to miss. I was simply wandering in my neighborhood after dinner and came upon an interesting photo. After I got a shot I liked, I came home and found out all this information online. One unresolved question for me: is this an example of an [apse chapel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apse_chapel)? I would guess yes because it's more complicated than a simple apse as part of the traditional basilica church structure.
