One of my go-to paintings in the Met is [Joan of Arc](http://metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/89.21.1) by [Jules Bastien-Lepage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Bastien-Lepage). I have visited the Met probably a dozen times since the turn of the millennium. Each visit, I have made a point of always stopping by the main hall of later European Paintings to pay my respects to Joan. 

I don't remember the first time I saw this painting; perhaps in high school, but definitely by the mid to late 90's. From my first encounter, I was struck by several things:

 * Joan's beauty
 * Her otherworldly gaze
 * The scale of the painting
 * The three mysterious saints bearing halos and floating to the center left of the painting

If I don't get too distracted by all the other works at the Met, I will revisit Joan over the next several days during this NYC trip to really absorb this painting.
