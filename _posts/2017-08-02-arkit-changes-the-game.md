[Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_VR), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_(platform)), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), and [MagicLeap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Leap) have all made public and significant investments in [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) / [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) (AR/VR) over the last few years. Apple skeptics have kvetched that Cupertino was falling behind in AR/VR.

They needn't have worried.

Apple announced [ARkit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) in early June at [WWDC](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/). Before the end of 2017,  hundreds of millions of consumers will have AR experiences in their pockets. It is no exaggeration to say that Apple will instantly become the largest AR platform on the planet. I wasn't able to watch the [WWDC keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqHdULqet0) live but when I did a few weeks later, I was blown away.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

I wasn't alone.  [Made with ARkit](https://twitter.com/madewitharkit?lang=en) launched as a Twitter account in June and within days it gained tens of thousands of followers. The account is unaffiliated with Apple and [continually](https://youtu.be/rIPfpGCxONQ) [features](https://youtu.be/ZBdRAdSosv4)  [impressive](https://youtu.be/AvwvHIv7nwo) [demos](https://youtu.be/oFdgVNg4ryM) by third-party developers. 

Developer excitement is palpable. [These demos](http://www.madewitharkit.com) show that building professional AR apps will be relatively easy with ARkit. Most importantly, devs have guaranteed access to a market of hundreds of millions of compatible devices. No other AR/VR vendor will be able to promise that many end-users for some time to come. AR veteran [Matt Miesnieks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmiesnieks/) has written an excellent, in-depth [article](https://medium.com/super-ventures-blog/why-is-arkit-better-than-the-alternatives-af8871889d6a) comparing ARkit with its competitors. Apple's software stack leverages the same software as Google's Tango project. Microsoft Hololens uses similar software but has superior tracking compared to Apple because Microsoft integrates special [ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) in its hardware.  Magic Leap has deeply impressed the few people who have received private demos in Florida. But as Steven Sinofsky [observed](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/wwdc-2017-some-thoughts-3ff3230cdd58) after WWDC, 

>iOS is the healthiest developer ecosystem right now. [The biggest driver is probably] the unprecedented scale of customers and ability for Apple to deliver new software APIs to developers that will make it to 100’s of millions of devices in short order... 
>
>[New] frameworks, but particularly for augmented reality, are moving well beyond incremental and addressing needs building today’s apps...
>
>One measure of the potential for a new framework is how fast new applications show up that show off the capabilities. In the case of ARKit, demos showed up before the morning sessions the next day...While “glasses” AR platforms are busy trying to recreate a phone and phone s/w platform that either fits in glasses or can be easily tethered, Apple already has a device and platform at massive scale. Frankly, it is not hard to imagine a peripheral that takes advantage of this and brings hands-free. Or maybe not, since this capability will be so rich and accessible. With this release of ARKit, Apple will start the flywheel of API->Apps->Feedback->Features that is the hallmark of new and differentiated capabilities. 

2018 is shaping up to be very interesting.

<sup id="fn1">1. The [WWDC demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaqHdULqet0) is well worth watching. It's only 5 minutes long and starts 1:25:30 into the keynote.<a href="#ref1" title="Return to text.">↩</a></sup>
