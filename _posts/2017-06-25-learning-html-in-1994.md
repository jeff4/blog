I began researching machine learning in a serious way [last December](/blog/2016/springtime-for-machine-learning/). Rather than a somewhat straightforward transition like applying my marketing background to an AI-powered product, I've been diving into the fundamental math that underlies machine learning.

In particular, I've been studying the  excellent [Deep Learning textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. In order to  engage with the material, I've spent months re-learning and learning for the first time several topics including [linear algebra](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/), [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant), statistics, [Bayesian probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability), [formal definitions of functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/v/a-more-formal-understanding-of-functions) and vector transformations, and even [some elementary manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold).

I'm hardly alone in believing that machine learning is a powerful, fundamental shift in the tech industry. But I think people still don't quite get it. My studies feel a bit like someone learning HTML, HTTP, and other  Internet standards [circa 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape#History). If your risk-averse parents asked why you weren't studying for the LSAT, you could hardly tell your mom and dad that you were planning on being an Internet entrpreneur in 1998 or a professional manager of [SEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_marketing#History) in 2005. But I'm convinced that 5 and 10 years down the line, my homework now is going to pay dividends.
