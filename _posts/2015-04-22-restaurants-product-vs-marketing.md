What is the relationship between Product and Marketing? I've long used a simple analogy to explain the difference: the steak and its sizzle. Product cooks the steak; Marketing and Sales deliver the sizzle that bring customers to eat the steak. In an ideal world, a company would obviously love to have both delicious steak and irresistible sizzle. If one had to choose, one would go with only sizzle. Steak without sizzle may be [vaporware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware), but vaporware can buy time until the product is within striking distance of excellence.

I mentioned this to a friend recently who has experience with professional chefs. She asked, "Wait. So—is the marketer the person who plates the food? Who serves the garnish? Who serves the food? And how does the chef produce the steak? Just by cooking, or by sourcing ingredients?" I realized that this simple analogy just wasn't cutting it.

I have a new food-related proposal to explain the relationship between marketing and product: inside and outside of a restaurant. Marketing is responsible for everything up until the customer walks into the restaurant. Product is responsible for everything after the customer comes in.

Product is not just the core offering (the food); it's also the surrounding dining experience within the establishment. It includes the overall decor, the way the customer is welcomed and seated, the layout of the tables, the way the menu is designed, and the complete service that customer delivered. If the guest has a great experience, she will come back—a repeat diner because the great product experience created a loyal customer.

Marketing is everything that happens *before* the customer gets to the door. Marketing includes, signage, promotions, advertisements, word of mouth, reviews, and—crucially in the restaurant business—location.
