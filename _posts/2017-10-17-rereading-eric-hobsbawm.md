The British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm was born in 1917 and by the end of his long life at in 2012, [The Guardian wrote that he was](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm) "arguably Britain's most respected historian of any kind, recognised if not endorsed on the right as well as the left, and one of a tiny handful of historians of any era to enjoy genuine national and world renown." 

Hobsbawm published the classic [*The Age of Revolution, 1789-1848*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Revolution:_Europe_1789–1848) in 1962. It was the first volume in a [trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Capital:_1848–1875) of [books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Empire:_1875–1914) about 19th century Europe that introduced the concept of the ["long 19th-century"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_nineteenth_century) lasting from the French Revolution in 1789 to the beginning of World War I in 1914.

I first read *The Age of Revolution* on its 35th anniversary. In some ways Hobsbawm taught me more about Europe than my excellent high school and college courses did. His trilogy–along with his fourth volume about the "short 20th-century" [The Age of Extremes, 1914-1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Extremes)–had a big impact on my intellectual development when when I was coming of age. Throughout the 2000's, I became focused on other historical topics like [the American Civil War](http://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-119), [slavery](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/inhuman-bondage-9780195140736?cc=us&lang=en&), race, and [peace and nonviolence in the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unconquerable_World). As such, I lost track of Hobsbawm and didn't realize that he published a well-reviewed [autobiography in 2002](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4) and bracing [collection of essays](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/22/change-world-marx-eric-hobsbawm-review) in 2011–at the age of 94!

I picked up *The Age of Revolutions* again recently as a refresher on late 18th-century France in parallel to reading [Hilary Mantel's historical novel set during the French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_of_Greater_Safety). This exercise in re-reading Hobsbawm has put me in a contemplative mood about more than the seminal and terrible events of 220 years ago. *The Age of Revolutions* is now 55 years old.  Historiography has evolved a lot in the last half-century.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> More personally, it's startling to think about how I'm a different person than I was 20 years ago when I first read Hobsbawm.

<sup id="fn1">1. As a working 21st-century historian, [Matt Karp](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737259) takes a [balanced view of The Age of Revolution 50 years after its publication](https://earlyamericanists.com/2013/02/07/a-very-old-book-the-case-for-eric-hobsbawms-age-of-revolution/).  I'm planning on finally reading Karp's fascinating [This Vast Southern Empire](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737259) someday.<a href="#ref1" title="Return to text.">↩</a></sup>
