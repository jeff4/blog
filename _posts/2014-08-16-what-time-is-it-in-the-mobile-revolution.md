The "mobile revolution" is a term I dislike.  It's like saying the "jet travel revolution" or the "electricity revolution" at this point.  It should be baked into all of our business assumptions. But until we have a better phrase, I'll keep using that term.  

[Two](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/4/7/in-mobile-everything-is-still-wide-open) [articles](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/7/21/leverage) by Benedict Evans at Andreessen Horowitz the last few months have really stimulated my thinking. Everyone "knows" that mobile is huge.  **But here we are 7 years into the iOS/Android era, and most people still underestimate how big, fast, deep, and unpredictable this dislocation is.**  We're at this moment where iOS developers are incented to stupid gimmicky behavior to game App Store rankings.  Where end users are not showing up in Android web stats (esp for tablets). Where [Erickson is predicting almost 6B people](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/05/18/astonishing-number-ericsson-predicts-5-9-billion-smarpthone-users-within-5-years/) will have internet-connected smartphones within 5 years.

Analogies are dangerous, but here we go:

1. It's like the PC market in 1983, [before the launch of Lotus 1-2-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3#Beginnings). Sure the PC revolution was already 6 years old by that point -- if you measure by the launch of the Apple II.  The IBM PC had launched in 1981 and was well on its way to being the dominant hardware platform.  But even in 1983, so much was still  undetermined.  1-2-3 was the killer app that drove adoption of PCs (esp. in business) and established Lotus as the biggest software company in the world for a while.
2. It's like the desktop internet before Google ([as Benedict Evans, says, "Pre-PageRank"](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/4/7/in-mobile-everything-is-still-wide-open)).  This means 1997 or so.
3. Evans also suggests that we are still pre-Netscape in terms of having a single interaction model. I'd argue that by the nature of the devices, software, and sensors, it will never be as unified as the desktop internet from that UX perspective.  In that case, [we're in the web era circa 1993](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/4/7/in-mobile-everything-is-still-wide-open).
What would I have done if I was in place to do something in the PC revolution in 1983?  Or at the dawn of the mainstream web in 1993 or 1997?  I think we're at that moment now with whatever we call the current period: mobile, wearables, pervasive IP, internet of things, etc.  In fact, it's even better because people in 2008 had to guess about which platforms were going to win.  At least for the next 3-7 years, it's clearly going to be a mix of iOS and Android.  And the scale of this transition is between 5x - 50x what we saw with the PC revolution. 

This is an academic question: what time is it in the mobile revolution.  A better question: what is to be done?
