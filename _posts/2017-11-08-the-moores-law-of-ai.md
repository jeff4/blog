Is there an equivalent to Moore's Law to measure the explosion of interest and capability in AI? I don't have an answer but I've started asking the question. My thinking was spurred by the throwaway line in this passage from a recent article in the[MIT magazine Spectrum](https://spectrum.mit.edu/fall-2017/how-can-computers-apply-what-theyve-learned-to-new-situations/): 

>The hottest ticket on the MIT campus this fall is...an undergraduate class in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) whose humble course catalog label, 6.036, belies its exponentially growing popularity. The subject, *Introduction to Machine Learning*, was first offered in 2013 and now attracts hundreds more students than can fit into a 500-seat lecture hall. In addition to enrolling droves of EECS students, 6.036 brings in registrants from nearly every discipline MIT offers, from architecture to management. The irresistible draw? **A chance to get a jump on the most powerful driver of technology innovation since Moore’s Law.**

For 50 years, the tech industry has been powered by [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law). In 1965, co-founder of Intel [Gordon Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore) observed that the number of components per integrated circuit had doubled every 12 months since the 1950's. He predicted that it would continue to do so for the next decade.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 

Moore's Law is not a law of nature like Newton's laws of gravity; rather it was a historical observation and aspirational benchmark. Nevertheless, Moore's law–in comination with [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling#Relation_with_Moore.27s_law_and_computing_performance)–has been an essential factor in driving the tech revolution.

Moore's Law [may or may not be slowing down](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8013504/), but I'm interested in other times where exponential increase has presaged technological shifts that encourage entrepreneurial activity. Two other examples come to mind related to the internet: [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) and the stunning growth of the web in the early 1990's.

Jeff Bezos saw a research report in 1994 that predicted that the web would grow 2300% per year. He quit his lucrative Wall Street job a few months later to move to the west coast. When [Success Magazine asked him in 1998](1998 Success article -- https://www.success.com/article/from-the-archives-jeff-bezos) why he moved so quickly to found Amazon, he replied:

>“That figure of 2,300 percent,” he says. “That’s huge. Nothing usually grows that fast outside a petri dish. With that kind of growth rate, a sense of urgency becomes your most valuable asset.”

We don't currently have a good definition of what the AI equivalent for Moore's law is. I can propose some possibilities but I suspect that most of them will be less useful than Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to coin ["Zuckerberg's Law of Information Sharing" circa 2008](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/zuckerbergs-law-of-information-sharing/) which has [not quite taken off](https://www.fastcodesign.com/1672296/mark-zuckerberg-might-be-right-about-the-moores-law-of-sharing) in the same way as Moore's Law.

Regardless of the actual metric we use for AI, it would be useful to come up with something that tracks the growing breadth, depth, and power of machine intelligence as it changes every aspect of the tech industry in the decades to come.
