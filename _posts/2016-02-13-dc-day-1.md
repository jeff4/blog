This Monday is President’s Day; a work holiday. At the last minute, I decided to book a quick vacation to Washington, DC. During the three-day weekend, I planned to spend two solid days visiting museums. Things haven’t quite worked out that way.

This trip will always be memorable because: (1) I was in DC when I learned of [Antonin Scalia’s death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia#Death) and (2) it took me **20-hours** door-to-door to get from my apartment in Seattle to my hotel in DC, cutting short my available time to see art. Originally, I planned to arrive at my hotel around 11 AM today (Saturday). Unfortunately, my plane left without me even though I arrived early to the gate and was literally waiting at the gate for my final boarding pass. This led to a scramble for alternative outbound flights and actually sleeping on the bench overnight at SeaTac last night! I finally got to the hotel 8 hours after originally—almost **a full day since leaving Bellevue, WA**. This leaves only a day and a half for art.

Ah well. I still hope this trip proves worthwhile as DC holds many works by [Mark Rothko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko). Rothko has been on my mind for a few years now; even more so since I started taking my acrylic class recently. I was bummed to see that I missed a great  [Rothko retrospective](http://www.mfah.org/exhibitions/past/mark-rothko-retrospective/) in at the [MFAH](http://www.mfah.org/about/) in Houston. That show paired works from the National Gallery in DC with the permanent display at [the Rothko Chapel](http://www.rothkochapel.org/). If I can’t meet the Rothkos in Texas, I’ll just go find them in their permanent home in DC. In addition to the [National Gallery of Art](http://www.nga.gov/), I’m looking forward to visiting the [Rothko Room](http://www.phillipscollection.org/collection/rothko-room) at [The Phillips Collection](http://www.phillipscollection.org/about) in Dupont Circle.

OK, I’m off to brave the 19 degree F weather to see if the Texas BBQ at [Hill Country](http://hillcountry.com/dc/) lives up to the reviews on [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hill-country-bbq-market-washington).
