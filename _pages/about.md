Welcome to my personal blog!

I have more than [15 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhwang) as a product manager and tech marketer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Box](https://www.box.com/home), and range of startups. I currently work with the Microsoft developer marketing team but my writings here reflect my own opinions and not those of my employer.

Artificial intelligence has come a long way from when I started learning about neural networks in the 1990's. I'm planning on writing more about machine learning, customer-driven development, and other topics throughout 2017 and beyond.
