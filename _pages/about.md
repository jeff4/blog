title: Welcome to my blog

Hello! I've spent the last few years developing a more rigorous understanding of [deep neural networks](/blog/2017/histories-of-deep-learning/). Please follow my journey [here](/).

Since late 2016, I've reviewed [vector calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Applied-Mathematics-Computing-Science/dp/0198596529/) and [linear algebra](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319110790) in depth. I also spent a few months during the summer of 2018 studying [General Adversarial Networks](/blog/2018/GANs-part-2-counterfeit-money/). Beyond artificial intelligence, I'm interested in [education](/blog/2015/why-college/), [art](/tags/#art), [history](/tags/#history), and strategy. 

I first read about [artificial neural networks](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/parallel-distributed-processing) back in the 1990's when I  studied [cognitive neuroscience](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/research-themes/cognitive-neuroscience) as part of my undergraduate [biology](https://oeb.harvard.edu) major at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu). AI has certainly come a long way since then! Later, I received an [MBA](http://mitsloan.mit.edu) from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), where I got to do fun stuff like [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction) and [computational biology](http://csbi.mit.edu) in [Course 6](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/).

Professionally, I have [two decades of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhwang) in product management, integrated marketing, and technology strategy at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Box](https://www.box.com/home), and several Silicon Valley startups.
