title: Welcome to my blog
---
I have [17 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhwang) as a product manager and tech marketer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Box](https://www.box.com/home), and several Silicon Valley startups. 

I first read about [artificial neural networks](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/parallel-distributed-processing) when I  studied [cognitive neuroscience](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/research-themes/cognitive-neuroscience) as part of my undergraduate [biology](https://oeb.harvard.edu) major at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu) in the 1990's. AI has certainly come a long way since then! Later, I received an [MBA](http://mitsloan.mit.edu) from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), where I got to do fun stuff like [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction) and [computational biology](http://csbi.mit.edu) in [Course 6](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/).

Currently taking a personal sabbatical to study some math fundamentals with the goal of developing a more rigorous understanding of deep neural networks.
