Hello! I'm on sabbatical and you can follow my journey [here](/).

My main focus at the moment is reviewing [linear algebra](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html) and [vector calculus](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Applied-Mathematics-Computing-Science/dp/0198596529/) with an eye towards developing a more rigorous understanding of deep neural networks. I'm also interested in [education](/blog/2015/why-college/), [art](/tags/#art), [history](/tags/#history), and [strategy](/blog/2017/arkit-changes-the-game/). 

I first read about [artificial neural networks](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/parallel-distributed-processing) back in the 1990's when I  studied [cognitive neuroscience](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/research-themes/cognitive-neuroscience) as part of my undergraduate [biology](https://oeb.harvard.edu) major at [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu). AI has certainly come a long way since then! Later, I received an [MBA](http://mitsloan.mit.edu) from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), where I got to do fun stuff like [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction) and [computational biology](http://csbi.mit.edu) in [Course 6](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/).

Professionally, I have [17 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhwang) as a product manager and tech marketer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Box](https://www.box.com/home), and several Silicon Valley startups.
